    content: `
      <p>Situated on a hillside overlooking Loch Lomond, this 350 square metre residence demonstrates how contemporary architecture can enhance rather than dominate a sensitive landscape. The design emerged from careful site analysis, positioning the home to maximise southern light and western views while sheltering from prevailing winds.</p>

      <p>The building's form responds to the topography, stepping down the slope to reduce its apparent mass. Floor-to-ceiling glazing frames carefully composed views of the loch and surrounding mountains, while deep overhangs provide solar shading and weather protection. Local stone and timber cladding help the building nestle into its context.</p>

      <p>Environmental performance was central to the brief. The home achieves Passivhaus standards through exceptional insulation, airtightness, and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery. Ground-source heat pumps provide underfloor heating, powered by photovoltaic panels integrated into the roof design. Rainwater harvesting supplies non-potable water needs.</p>

      <p>Interior spaces flow seamlessly from intimate family areas to generous entertaining spaces. A central courtyard brings light deep into the plan while providing sheltered outdoor space. Material choices emphasise natural textures and honest expression of structure, creating warmth and connection to the landscape.</p>

    content: `
      <p>This Grade A listed townhouse in Edinburgh's New Town required careful balance between conservation and contemporary family living. Built in 1795, the property had suffered inappropriate alterations over two centuries. Our approach focused on revealing and restoring original fabric while discreetly inserting modern services and amenities.</p>

      <p>Working closely with Historic Environment Scotland, we restored decorative plasterwork, reinstated original room proportions, and repaired traditional sash-and-case windows. Where original features had been lost, we designed sympathetic replacements based on archival research and surviving examples in neighbouring properties.</p>

      <p>Contemporary intervention was concentrated in former service areas. A new kitchen and family room occupy the ground floor rear extension, featuring minimal-framed glazing that opens to a landscaped garden. Below, a previously unused basement now houses a media room, wine cellar, and plant room for modern heating and ventilation systems.</p>

      <p>Upgrading building performance within conservation constraints required innovative solutions. Internal wall insulation uses breathable materials compatible with traditional construction. Discreet underfloor heating in non-historic areas supplements restored fireplaces. The result is a comfortable family home that respects its Georgian character while meeting 21st-century expectations.</p>
